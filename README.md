# ToDo App

Have you been looking for a reliable todo list app? Well, you're in the right place! This app will let you add and delete tasks to new and existing todo lists!

# Purpose

The purpose for this program is to provide users with a great todo app! We all want to be able to store all those things we need to do and come back to check them off or delete them later.

## Getting Started

Due to Java not supporting JSON files, we can only run this on an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Make sure you have openjdk version 19.0.1 or newer installed and running on your machine. Start your IDE and open the project folder, from there navigate to the src folder. Select the App.java file and click the "run" button.
